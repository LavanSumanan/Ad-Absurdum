# Ad-Absurdum

Sick of pesky ads? Why not replace them with frisky memes! Ad Absurdum removes an eyesore in everyday browsing, advertisements, and replaces them with fun, goofy drawings and inspirational quotes!

While we could have just removed the ads and saved ourselves lots of time, where's the fun in that? Instead, we spent hours replacing ads with better ones! Impractical? Maybe. Fun? Absolutely!

## To try it out for yourself...
1) Download this repository as a `.zip` file.
2) Open the `.zip` file to reveal a folder.
3) Open google chrome and type in `chrome://extensions`.
4) Flick the **Developer Mode** switch in the top right corner.
5) Click on **Load Unpacked** and select the *Ad-Absurdum* folder.
6) Click the spinning arrow to refresh the extension, and then head to a chrome tab with ads on it.
7) Finally, select *Ad Absurdum* in your chrome extensions and click on one of the four themes to replace your ads!

## Note: Ad Absurdum must reload webpages to replace ads with memes. As well, Ad Absurdum does not replace every advertisement; it only replaces advertisements from known advertisement addresses.
